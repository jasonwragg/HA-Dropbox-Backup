# Backup to Dropbox

A Home Assistant custom integration that adds a **Dropbox** backup agent to the native Backup UI, allowing you to create, list, download, and delete snapshots directly from your Dropbox account.

---

## Features

- **Full BackupAgent Support**: Implements all core methods—`async_list_backups`, `async_upload_backup`, `async_download_backup`, `async_delete_backup`—integrating deeply with Home Assistant’s Backup system.
- **Config Flow**: Authenticate with Dropbox using OAuth 2 via Home Assistant Application Credentials.
- **Pagination Handling**: Correctly pages through Dropbox folder listings to show every snapshot.
- **Error Logging**: Provides detailed debug logs for upload, download, and metadata operations.
- **Chunked Uploads**: Streams backups to Dropbox in 4 MB chunks for faster uploads of large files.

---

## Requirements

- **Home Assistant Core 2025.1+** (Backup Agents API introduced in 2025.1).
- A Dropbox **Scoped Access** app with an App key and secret, and the following scopes enabled:
  - `files.content.write`
  - `files.content.read`
  - `files.metadata.read`.
- **HACS** (Home Assistant Community Store) for easy installation (optional).

## Usage

- **Create Backup**: **Settings → System → Backups → Create**, choose **Dropbox**, and follow prompts.
- **List Backups**: Dropbox-stored snapshots appear automatically in the list.
- **Restore**: Select a Dropbox snapshot, click **Restore**, and follow the wizard.
- **Delete**: Use the three-dot menu on any Dropbox backup entry and choose **Delete**.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`missing_scope` errors**: Ensure your Dropbox app has the required scopes enabled, then reauthorize the integration.
- **No backups listed**: Verify the **Folder** path matches your Dropbox folder and contains `.tar` snapshots.
- **UI 404 errors**: Avoid illegal characters in folder names and ensure IDs are URL-decoded properly.
